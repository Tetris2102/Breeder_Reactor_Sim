# Breeder_Reactor_Sim

A little and simplified java simulation of a breeder reactor with Th-232 fuel and an (Î±, n) neutron source.
The main goal of this project is to be able to see how mass percentage of isotopes in fuel changes with time.
It also should be able to track activity of any and all isotopes and its type (alpha, beta, gamma, neutron).
