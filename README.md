# Breeder_Reactor_Sim

A little and simplified java simulation of a breeder reactor with Th-232 fuel and an (Î±, n) neutron source.
The main goal of this project is to be able to see how masses of isotopes in fuel change with time.
It also should be able to track activity of all isotopes and its type (alpha, beta, gamma, neutron).

To run an example simulation, open the terminal and type:
```
git clone https://github.com/Tetris2102/Breeder_Reactor_Sim.git
cd Breeder_Reactor_Sim/classes
java breeder.Main
```

To simulate breeder reactor, add 10 grams of th-232. Then set source isotope to pu-238 and target isotope to be-9 with source mass of 1 gram.
After simulating the reactor, you can measure alpha, beta or gamma decay spectrum of fuel.

Enjoy nuclear physics!
